# Customer Portal

## Visibility for customers. Control for you.

ServiFlow's customer portal gives your customers a way to submit requests, track progress, and confirm resolutions—without exposing your internal operations.

### What customers can do

**Submit requests**
Customers raise tickets through the portal. They select a category, describe the issue, and attach files if needed. The request enters your queue with appropriate routing and SLA assignment.

**View their tickets**
Customers see all tickets raised by anyone in their company. They can filter by status, read the conversation history, and check current progress.

**Communicate**
Customers add comments to their tickets. These appear in your timeline alongside your public replies. Your internal notes remain hidden.

**Accept or reject resolutions**
When you mark a ticket resolved, the customer can confirm the fix or reopen if the issue persists. This closes the loop on every request.

### What customers cannot see

The portal shows only what's relevant to the customer. They do not have access to:

- **Internal notes** — Comments between your team members
- **SLA targets** — Response and resolution deadlines
- **Breach status** — Whether you're meeting or missing service levels
- **Other customers** — Complete separation between companies
- **Your team's workload** — Capacity, assignments, queues
- **Reporting or analytics** — Operational dashboards
- **Configuration items** — Unless you explicitly enable asset visibility

This boundary keeps your service delivery mechanics internal.

### Company administrators

Within each customer company, you can designate administrators.

Company administrators can:
- View all tickets for their company
- Invite new users
- Disable users who leave

They cannot:
- See other customer companies
- Change SLA settings
- Access your internal systems

This lets customers manage their own user accounts without your involvement.

---

### Authentication

Each customer user has their own login.

Users are created by:
- Your team sending an invitation
- A company administrator adding them
- Self-registration if you enable it

Users belong to exactly one company. There is no cross-company access.

### Communication record

The portal creates a structured record of all customer interaction.

Every request, response, and resolution is attached to a ticket. Email notifications keep customers informed, but the conversation lives in ServiFlow—not scattered across inboxes.
