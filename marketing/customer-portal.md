# Customer Portal

## Give customers visibility without giving away control

ServiFlow's customer portal lets your customers view their tickets, submit new requests, and communicate with your team—without seeing your internal operations, other customers, or SLA mechanics.

### What customers can do

**View their tickets**
Customers see all tickets raised by anyone in their company. They can filter by status, see the current state of each issue, and read the public conversation history.

**Submit new requests**
Customers can raise new tickets directly from the portal. They select a category, describe the issue, and optionally attach files. The ticket enters your normal queue with appropriate SLA assignment.

**Communicate with your team**
Customers can add comments to their tickets. These appear in your ticket timeline alongside your public responses. Internal notes remain hidden.

**Accept or reject resolutions**
When you mark a ticket as resolved, the customer can confirm the resolution or reopen the issue if it's not actually fixed. This closes the loop on every ticket.

### What customers cannot see

The portal is deliberately limited. Customers do not have access to:

- **Internal notes** — Private comments between your team members
- **SLA targets or timers** — Response and resolution deadlines are not exposed
- **Breach status** — Customers don't see whether you're meeting or missing SLAs
- **Other customers** — Complete isolation between customer companies
- **Assignee workload** — No visibility into your team's capacity or assignments
- **Operational dashboards** — No access to reporting or analytics
- **Configuration items** — CMDB is not exposed through the customer portal (unless explicitly configured)

This separation keeps your operational mechanics internal while giving customers the visibility they need.

### Company administrators

Within each customer company, you can designate company administrators.

Company admins can:
- View all tickets for their company (not just their own)
- Invite new users to their company
- Enable or disable users in their company

They cannot:
- See other companies
- Modify SLAs or service settings
- Access your internal systems

This lets your customers manage their own users without requiring your intervention for every new employee.

### Authentication

Customer users log in with their own credentials. Accounts are created by:
- Your team inviting them from the admin console
- Company administrators inviting them from the portal
- Self-registration (if enabled for the customer company)

Each user belongs to exactly one customer company. There's no cross-company access.

---

### Communication channel

The customer portal is the primary channel for structured communication.

- Customers submit requests through the portal
- Your team responds through the ticket system
- Email notifications keep customers informed of updates

This keeps all communication attached to tickets, creating a clear record of every interaction.
