# Managed Service Providers

## Multi-customer operations from one platform

ServiFlow's MSP tier is built for providers who deliver IT services to multiple customers. Each customer has their own SLAs, users, and assets. You have unified visibility and the governance to run a professional operation.

---

### The structure

As an MSP, you are the tenant. Your customers are companies within your tenant.

Each customer company has:
- **Users** — People who submit tickets and access the portal
- **Assets** — Configuration items you manage for them
- **SLAs** — Service levels defined for their contract
- **Tickets** — Complete history of service delivery

Your team works across all customers from a single interface. Customers see only their own data.

---

### SLA flexibility

Different customers pay for different service levels. ServiFlow supports this with:

**Company-level SLAs**
Assign a default SLA to each customer. All their tickets inherit this SLA unless something more specific applies.

**User-level overrides**
Within a customer company, individual users can have enhanced SLAs. The CFO gets priority response while other staff use standard timelines.

**Ticket overrides**
For critical incidents, override the SLA directly on the ticket.

The hierarchy is deterministic. You always know which SLA applied and why.

---

### Customer separation

Customers cannot see each other.

- Ticket lists are scoped to the customer's company
- Assets are owned by specific customers
- Users belong to exactly one company
- The portal enforces these boundaries automatically

This separation is enforced at the data layer, not just the interface.

---

### Governance

Operating services for multiple customers requires accountability.

**Audit logging**
User actions, ticket changes, and configuration updates are logged with timestamps and attribution.

**Role-based access**
Your team members have defined permissions. Customers have limited portal access. No one can exceed their role.

**No anonymous actions**
Every operation in ServiFlow is tied to an authenticated user. There are no shared accounts that hide who did what.

---

### Operational reporting

You need data to manage contracts and run your business.

ServiFlow tracks:
- Ticket volumes per customer
- SLA performance per customer
- Asset counts and status
- User activity

Export this data for billing systems, contract reviews, or internal dashboards.

---

### Billing model

ServiFlow does not bill your customers.

You pay for the platform. How you charge your customers is your business. ServiFlow provides the data you need for billing but does not process payments or invoices on your behalf.

---

### Getting started

MSP configuration is not self-serve.

When you choose the MSP tier, we work with you to:
- Set up your customer structure
- Configure SLA definitions
- Import existing customers and users
- Establish your operational workflows

This ensures you start with a properly configured system rather than a blank slate.

### Is ServiFlow right for your MSP?

ServiFlow is designed for MSPs who:
- Deliver contracted IT services to multiple customers
- Need SLA tracking against business hours
- Want customer-facing visibility without exposing internal operations
- Require audit trails and operational governance

ServiFlow is not designed for:
- White-label portals with customer branding
- Direct billing to end customers through the platform
- Self-serve MSP signup without onboarding
