## Run your MSP on a platform built for multi-customer operations

ServiFlow's MSP tier isn't a feature upgrade—it's a different way of operating. You manage multiple customer relationships from a single platform, with the separation, SLA tracking, and governance that professional service delivery requires.

---

### Multi-customer operations

As an MSP, you serve multiple distinct customers. Each has their own:

- **Users** — Employees who submit tickets and access the portal
- **Configuration items** — Servers, workstations, and systems you manage
- **SLA definitions** — Service levels specific to their contract
- **Ticket history** — Complete record of service delivery

Your team works from a unified console. You see all tickets, all customers, all assets. Your customers see only their own.

---

### SLA as a service differentiator

Different customers pay for different service levels. ServiFlow supports this with:

**Customer-level SLAs**
Assign a default SLA to each customer company. All their tickets inherit this SLA unless overridden.

**User-level SLA overrides**
Within a customer company, specific users can have enhanced SLAs. This supports premium support tiers—the CFO gets 2-hour response while standard users get 8-hour response.

**Per-ticket overrides**
For specific critical issues, override the SLA directly on the ticket.

The SLA hierarchy is deterministic and auditable. You always know which SLA applies and why.

---

### Contracts and billing readiness

ServiFlow tracks the data you need for contract management and billing:

- Ticket volumes per customer
- SLA performance metrics per customer
- Asset counts per customer
- User counts per customer

You can export this data for your billing systems or use it in customer business reviews. ServiFlow doesn't bill your customers directly—that's your relationship to manage.

---

### Governance and audit

When you operate services for multiple customers, you need to demonstrate control:

**Audit logging**
User actions, ticket changes, and configuration modifications are logged with timestamps and user attribution.

**No ghost users**
Every action is tied to an authenticated user. There are no anonymous operations or shared service accounts that obscure accountability.

**Role-based access**
Define what each team member can see and do. Administrators, experts, and customers have different permissions enforced by the platform.

**Customer isolation**
Customers cannot see each other's data. This isn't just a UI filter—it's enforced at the data layer.

---

### Start simple, scale later

You don't need to configure everything on day one.

Start with:
- Basic ticket management
- One or two customer companies
- Default SLAs

Then add:
- Per-customer SLA configurations
- User-level overrides
- CMDB with SLA inheritance
- Advanced notification rules

ServiFlow grows with your operation. The platform is the same at 5 customers as it is at 50.

### Guided onboarding

MSP configuration isn't self-serve.

When you sign up for the MSP tier, we work with you to:
- Understand your customer structure
- Configure appropriate SLA definitions
- Set up business hours profiles
- Import existing customers and users
- Establish operational workflows

This ensures you start with a properly configured system, not a blank slate you have to figure out yourself.

### Is ServiFlow right for your MSP?

ServiFlow is designed for MSPs who:
- Deliver contracted IT services to multiple customers
- Need SLA tracking with business hours awareness
- Want operational visibility without exposing internals to customers
- Require audit trails and governance controls

ServiFlow is not designed for:
- MSPs who need white-label portals with customer branding
- Resellers who want to bill customers directly through the platform
- Operations that require deep PSA integrations out of the box
