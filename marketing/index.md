## Integrations {#integrations}

### Integrations that scale with your service model

### When to choose each plan

**Starter** works if you need ticketing with SLA tracking and email-based workflows. You get the foundations without integration complexity.

**Professional** unlocks collaboration tools, monitoring integrations, and identity providers. Choose this when you serve external customers with defined SLAs and need your tools connected.

**MSP** adds customer-facing channels, billing system connectivity, and full automation access. Built for providers managing multiple customers at scale with distinct contracts and routing requirements.

## How it works {#how}

### 1. Ingest

Tickets arrive from email, portal, service catalogue, or monitoring sources.

### 2. Classify

Rules and AI work together to identify the customer, suggest categories, and match CMDB items.

### 3. Route

The rule engine assigns tickets based on skills, workload, and customer requirements. AI suggests the best expert.

### 4. Resolve

Experts receive knowledge base suggestions and resolution templates. AI assists but humans confirm.

### 5. Track

SLA clocks track response and resolution within business hours. Near-breach alerts trigger escalation.

### 6. Deliver

Customers see clean progress updates. Resolution acceptance confirms service completion.

---

## Security & governance {#security}

- Role-based access by tenant, company, and user
- Audit logging for all operations, including AI suggestions
- Re-auth patterns for high-risk actions
- Clear ownership and separation of responsibilities

**Tenant isolation** — Your data is not mixed with other tenants. There is no mechanism to query another tenant's data.

**No anonymous operations** — Every action is tied to an authenticated user. No shared service accounts that obscure attribution.

**AI governance** — All AI suggestions are logged with confidence scores. Accepted and rejected suggestions are tracked. AI never acts autonomously — human confirmation is always required.

---

## FAQ {#faq}

### Is ServiFlow only for MSPs?

No. MSPs get the most leverage, but internal IT teams can start on Starter and scale up when needed.

### How does SLA selection work?

ServiFlow applies the most specific SLA deterministically in this order: Ticket override → customer → category → CMDB → default.

### Do SLAs respect working hours?

Yes. Targets are computed within business windows and the clock pauses outside business hours.

### Can we route monitoring alerts without creating fake customers?

Yes. Monitoring/system sources are classified and tickets are created under a system requester with clear reasoning.

### Which integrations are available now?

Email, Microsoft Teams, and monitoring alert ingest are available. Identity providers and escalation tools are in active development. Check the capability matrix above for current status.

### How does AI work in ServiFlow?

AI operates alongside structured knowledge, rules, CMDB data, and service catalogues — not as a replacement for them. AI provides triage suggestions, expert matching, CMDB linking, and performance insights. All AI output requires human confirmation and is fully auditable.

### Is AI autonomous or chatbot-based?

No. ServiFlow AI enhances human decision-making, not replaces it. There is no autonomous ticket resolution or chatbot-only interaction. AI suggestions are presented to experts who confirm, modify, or reject them.

### Can we expose services to customers?

Yes. Service catalogues can be published to customer portals and embedded in external websites. Customers see service menus aligned with your operational workflows and can submit structured requests.
