## Integrations {#integrations}

### Integrations that scale with your service model

ServiFlow connects to the tools your team already uses. Integrations unlock based on your operating model — starting with inbound workflows that create tickets and escalate issues, then expanding to customer channels and billing systems as you scale.

[CARDS]

**Collaboration**
Microsoft Teams (available)
Slack (planned)

**Monitoring & Alerts**
Nagios, Zabbix, PRTG
Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana
Alerts become tickets with SLA awareness

**Identity & Access**
Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
Google Workspace

**Ticket & Dev Escalation**
Jira
GitHub Issues
GitLab Issues

**Customer Channels**
Email (all plans)
WhatsApp Business (MSP, planned)
SMS (MSP, planned)

**Billing & Contracts**
Xero (MSP, planned)
QuickBooks (MSP, planned)

[/CARDS]

All integrations focus on operational workflows first. Deep bi-directional sync is implemented only where it adds real service value.

### When to choose each plan

**Starter** works if you need ticketing with SLA tracking and email-based workflows. You get the foundations without integration complexity.

**Professional** unlocks collaboration tools, monitoring integrations, and identity providers. Choose this when you serve external customers with defined SLAs and need your tools connected.

**MSP** adds customer-facing channels, billing system connectivity, and full automation access. Built for providers managing multiple customers at scale with distinct contracts and routing requirements.

## How it works {#how}

### 1. Ingest

Tickets arrive from email, portal, or monitoring sources.

### 2. Identify

The customer/company is identified and the correct SLA is applied deterministically.

### 3. Track

Response and resolution targets are tracked within business hours.

### 4. Notify

Alerts fire before breach and escalate consistently.

### 5. Deliver

Customers see a clean view of progress and outcomes.

---

## Security & governance {#security}

- Role-based access by tenant, company, and user
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Re-auth patterns for high-risk actions
- Clear ownership and separation of responsibilities

**Tenant isolation** — Your data is not mixed with other tenants. There is no mechanism to query another tenant's data.

**No anonymous operations** — Every action is tied to an authenticated user. No shared service accounts that obscure attribution.

## FAQ {#faq}

### Is ServiFlow only for MSPs?

No. MSPs get the most leverage, but internal IT teams can start on Starter and scale up when needed.

### How does SLA selection work?

ServiFlow applies the most specific SLA deterministically in this order: Ticket override → customer → category → CMDB → default.

### Do SLAs respect working hours?

Yes. Targets are computed within business windows and the clock pauses outside business hours.

### Can we route monitoring alerts without creating fake customers?

Yes. Monitoring/system sources are classified and tickets are created under a system requester with clear reasoning.

### Which integrations are available now?

Email, Microsoft Teams, and monitoring alert ingest are available. Identity providers and escalation tools are in active development. Check the integration matrix above for current status.
