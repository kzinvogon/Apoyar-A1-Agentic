# ServiFlow

## Service delivery that scales with your operation

From internal IT helpdesk to multi-customer managed services—one platform that adapts to how you actually work.

ServiFlow is an ITSM platform built for teams who deliver IT services. Whether you're supporting internal staff, serving external customers under SLA, or operating as an MSP across multiple accounts, ServiFlow provides the structure you need without the overhead you don't.

### How do you deliver services?

**Internal IT Team**
You support employees within your organisation. You need ticket management, asset tracking, and visibility into what's open and what's overdue.

**Managed Service Provider**
You deliver IT services to multiple customers, each with their own SLAs, users, and assets. You need tenant separation, SLA tracking per customer, and operational governance.

### Why ServiFlow

**Deterministic SLA tracking**
Every ticket gets an SLA. The system selects it automatically based on customer, category, or asset—and tracks response and resolution times against business hours.

**Customer portal without the noise**
Your customers see their tickets, submit requests, and accept resolutions. They don't see your internal notes, your other customers, or your SLA calculations.

**Asset management that connects to service delivery**
Link tickets to configuration items. Inherit SLAs from assets. Know which systems are generating the most work.

**Built for service operations**
ServiFlow is designed for teams who are accountable for service delivery—not for software vendors who want to track feature requests.
