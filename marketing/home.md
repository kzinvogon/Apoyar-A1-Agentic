# ServiFlow

## IT service management for teams that deliver

ServiFlow is a service desk platform built for three ways of working: internal IT support, customer-facing service delivery, and managed service operations.

Whether you run an internal helpdesk or deliver contracted services to dozens of customers, ServiFlow gives you ticket management, SLA tracking, and asset visibility—without forcing you into a workflow designed for someone else.

### Choose how you operate

**Internal IT**
Support your organisation's employees. Track requests, manage assets, and report on service performance. No external customers, no SLA complexity—just a clean ticket queue and the tools to work through it.

**Customer Service Delivery**
Serve external customers under defined service levels. Separate what your team sees from what customers see. Track response and resolution times against business hours. Give customers a portal without giving them your operational details.

**Managed Services**
Operate IT services for multiple customers from a single platform. Each customer gets their own SLAs, users, and assets. You get unified visibility and governance across all accounts.

### What ServiFlow does

**Tickets with context**
Every request has a clear owner, priority, and status. Link tickets to assets. See the full history. Know what's overdue before it becomes a problem.

**SLAs that run on business hours**
Define response and resolution targets. Assign them to customers, categories, or individual users. The clock only runs when you're open for business.

**Customer portal with boundaries**
Customers submit requests, track progress, and confirm resolutions. They don't see your internal notes, your SLA calculations, or your other customers.

**Configuration management for service delivery**
Track the systems you support. Link them to tickets. Know which assets generate the most work and which customers they belong to.
